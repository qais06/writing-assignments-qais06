# Website Template

Welcome! This repository is your personal course website. This is where all your writing assignments will reside.

## Goal
You will use this site to post your writing assignments.  
Each assignment will be an HTML file inside the `assignments/` folder.

## Workflow
1. Open the repository in GitHub.
2. Edit or create new HTML files:
   - Homepage: `index.html`
   - About page: `about.html`
   - Assignments: `assignments/assignment-title.html`
3. Commit and push changes. GitHub Pages will automatically update your site
  
## Tips
- Keep your homepage (`index.html`) updated with links to your assignments.
- Each assignment should be a separate HTML file in the `assignments/` folder.
- <a href="learnxinyminutes.com">learnxinyminutes.com</a> provides a highly succinct introduction to HTML syntax.

## Enable GitHub Pages
- Navigate to your repository.
- Click the "Settings" tab.
- Click "Pages" in the sidebar on the left.
- Ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch". This is the default setting.
- Select "main" from the Branch dropdown menu.
- Ensure the dropdown menu to the right of "main" is set to "/ (root)". This is the default setting.
- Click "Save".

Every time you edit index.html and commit the changes, the deployment flow will run. This flow will probably take less than a minute. Once the deployment flow has finished running for the first time, you will be able to view index.html as a website hosted at https://[username].github.io/[repository-name].
