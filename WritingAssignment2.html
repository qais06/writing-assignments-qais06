  <h1>Personas in Software Design</h1>

  <h2>Software Product</h2>
  <p>
    The software I discussed in Writing Assignment 1 is <strong>Notion</strong>.
    I believe it is designed well because it provides an intuitive, flexible, and visually clean
    interface that lets users organize their tasks, notes, and projects all in one place.
    The design emphasizes simplicity, drag-and-drop structure, and customization,
    which makes it appealing to a wide range of users — from students to professionals.
  </p>

  <h2>User Persona</h2>

  <h3>Name:</h3>
  <p>Sarah Lin</p>

  <h3>Age:</h3>
  <p>21 years old</p>

  <h3>Occupation:</h3>
  <p>University Student (Psychology Major)</p>

  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p>
    Sarah is a third-year university student who juggles multiple courses, part-time work,
    and extracurricular activities. She often struggles to stay organized across different
    platforms and wants a single place to track her notes, deadlines, and goals.
    She values a simple interface and visual layout that helps her see everything at a glance.
  </p>

  <h3>Goals:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay on top of assignments and deadlines</li>
    <li>Organize class notes efficiently</li>
    <li>Plan her weekly schedule and study sessions</li>
    <li>Reduce stress by keeping everything in one digital workspace</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Frustrations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dislikes switching between multiple apps for notes, tasks, and schedules</li>
    <li>Gets overwhelmed by cluttered or overly complex interfaces</li>
    <li>Finds it hard to keep motivation when tools are not visually engaging</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Technology Comfort Level:</h3>
  <p>Intermediate</p>

  <h3>How This Persona Uses Notion:</h3>
  <p>
    Sarah uses Notion to build a personal dashboard that combines her to-do list, class notes,
    and weekly planner. She creates a page for each course, adds checklists for assignments,
    and uses templates for consistent formatting. The ability to link pages, embed media,
    and customize views helps her stay productive and creative at the same time.
