  <h1>The Importance of Good Software Design</h1>

  <h2>Part 1 – Example of Good Design</h2>
  <p>
    One program that demonstrates great software design is <strong>Notion</strong>.
    It keeps a clean interface while letting users manage notes, projects, and databases
    however they like. Its consistent colors, icons, and drag-and-drop layout make it
    easy for new users to learn without sacrificing advanced features.

  <h2>Part 2 – Why Good Design Matters</h2>

    Good software design saves time for both users and developers.
    For users, intuitive layout and clear feedback reduce mistakes and frustration.
    For developers, well-structured code and consistent patterns make updates easier.
    In a competitive tech world, solid design is what keeps software scalable,
    usable, and enjoyable to work with. Very user friendly and compatible with chat gpt prompts.
